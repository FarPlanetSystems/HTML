# My website for a failed student society
## Introduction
With this project I wanted to practice my JS and HTML skills creating a sort of full-stack work with some basic tools.
There I used Node.js setting my server and backend working with MySQL DB. I also coded a desktop editor on python witch provides a basic functionality for user-friendly interface to update website contents.
## Getting started

## How does it work?
In order to run all this stuff you will need first of all to run the Express server. If you want to an article open the editor.py where you can simply enough write/change/delete your articles and send them to the server
In the backend we save the data in db. Static js script will then fetch that and create related DOM objects
